Features
--------

* Simulation of the the diffractometer
* SImulation of the pressure cell
* Optimization of  the collimator for the given pressure cell
* Produced the .stl or .scad file of the collimator to be 3D printed
* Produced the comparison in the diffraction pattern for with and without collimator
